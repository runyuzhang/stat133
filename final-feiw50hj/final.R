# The exam has a total of 100 points and for each task 
# the point is given in square brackets.
# The exam has 6 parts and the total number of points by part is:
# 15 pts : Part I, general R commands
# 20 pts : Part II, plotting
# 15 pts : Part III, apply and by statements
# 15 pts : Part IV, functions 
# 15 pts : Part V, simulations

# If you spend about 30 min or so reading instructions and the like
# this gives you 1.5 min per point -- the exam is LONG ON PURPOSE!
# Please just work your way through it the best you can, prioritizing
# things you can easily do and remember everyone else is also
# racing the clock and will be graded on a curve.

#### PART I : General R commands [15 pts]

# [1 pt]
# Create [x], a numeric vector of length 1200 with 
# entries: 3, 6, 9, 12, etc
x <- 1:1200 * 3

  
# [2 pts]
# Create [y], a list of length 10 where list k
# stores the output of the k-times multiplication
# table, including values up to 1000 so
# y[[1]] is 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000
# y[[2]] is 2, 4, 6, ..., 1000
# y[[3]] is 3, 6, 9, ..., 999

y <- lapply(1:10, function(x) 1:(1000 %/% x) * x)


# [1 pt]
# Create [z], a logical vector of length 5000 with entries
# TRUE and FALSE, where each value has
#  a probability 0.3 of being TRUE and 0.7 of being FALSE
# Hint: you can e.g. use [sample()], you will need to set all 4 arguments
set.seed(42)
z <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), size = 1000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
  
  
# [1 pt]
# Create [v], a numeric vector with the results of 100 rolls of a dice,
# i.e. each element is one of the numbers 1 through 6, with equal probability.
  set.seed(31415)
v <- sample(1:6, size = 100, replace = TRUE, prob = rep(1/6, 6))


# [1 pt]
# Create [w], a character vector of length 26 with entries:
# "aa", "ab", "ac", "ad", ..., "az"
# Hint: the variable [letters] is an inbuilt constant in R 
# and stores the alphabet (try typing letters)
set.seed(2718)
w <- as.vector(sapply(letters, function(x) paste("a", x, sep = "")))

  
# [1 pt]
# Create [m], a matrix of size 10x10 with entries that are

# (arrange the values by column, as per default)
set.seed(344)
m <- matrix(data = rnorm(100, mean = 8), nrow = 10, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)

  
# For the next few tasks you will use the data frame ChickWeight
# This data frame comes with R so you do not need to load any data.
# To get the size of the data frame type
# dim(ChickWeight)
# To see the first few lines type
# head(ChickWeight)
# There are 4 variables in the dataframe:
# > names(ChickWeight)
# [1] "weight" "Time"   "Chick"  "Diet"  

# [1 pt]
# Create [cw1] a subset of ChickWeight with Chicks on 
# Diet 1 at time 0

# LEAVE AS IS:
load("KaiserBabies.rda") 

# [1 pt]
# Create a table [t1] of the smoking history of the mothers using the variables
# [smoke] for the rows of the table and  [number] for the columns.

# Now create a table [t2] which is the same table as before except restricted
# to mothers with College education (use [ed])
# 
t2 <- table(infants[infants$ed == "College",]$smoke, infants[infants$ed == "College",]$number)


# [2 pts] 
# Calculate [bdiff], the difference in average birthweight [column bwt] between babies born to mothers
# that are 35 years or older and mothers that are under 35 years of age [use column age for mothers age]
#  
bdiff <- mean(na.omit(infants[infants$age >= 35, ]$bwt)) - mean(na.omit(infants[infants$age < 35, ]$bwt))

#### PART II : Plotting [20 pts]

##### Cars [8 pts total, 2+3+3]
# We will now use the dataset "mtcars" which is icluded in the R package.
# To look at the dataframe you can just type "mtcars" at the prompt
# It is a data frame of size 32x12

# [2 pts]
# Make a box plot of [mpg] by [cyl] (so 3 boxplots in one plot)
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)


# [3 pts]
# Use the function [lm()] to fit a regression model of [qsec] (1/4 mile time) regressed on [hp] (horsepower)
# Make a scatterplot of [qsec] versus [hp] and add the regression line to it
# Hint: the regression coefficients are stored in [coef] in the lm object and you can use [abline()] to
# add a line to a plot

line = lm(qsec ~ hp, data = mtcars)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$qsec)
abline(line$coefficients[1], line$coefficients[2])

# [3 pt]
# Make a scatterplot of [disp] (on y-axis) versus [wt] 
# where disp is the engine displacement in cu. in. and wt is the weight of the car in lb/1000.
# Color the plotting symbol by [am] (automatic or manual) (any 2 colors)
# Edit the labels on the x-axis and y-axis to state what the variables are.
# Hint: first do the plot without adding the colors.
plot(mtcars[mtcars$am == 0,]$disp, mtcars[mtcars$am == 0,]$wt, col = "red")
points(mtcars[mtcars$am == 1,]$disp, mtcars[mtcars$am == 1,]$wt, col = "green")

##### We will now use the World Bank Data [12 pts]
load("WorldBank.RData")

# [4 pts]
# Make a scatterplot of life expectancy ["life.expectancy"] vs. fertility ["fertility.rate"]
# The plotting symbol should be a small dot (.)
# Please color the symbols by region (pick any color for each region)
# You do _NOT_ need to add a legend saying which color is which region.
# Put on custom made x-axis and y-axis labels that fully describe the variables
# Add a vertical line at fertility=2.1 (the rate needed to maintain constant population size)
plot(WorldBank$fertility.rate, WorldBank$life.expectancy, col = WorldBank$region, xlab = "Fertility Rate", ylab = "Life Expectancy", pch = ".")
abline(v = 2.1)

# [4 pts]
# Do you see patterns in the plot?  You just plotted these variables for all years between 1960 and 2014.
# Please redo the plot, but this time put two plots side by side (hint: before plotting set par(mfrow=...) )
# The left plot should include only data from 1960, the right one only from 2014.
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
WorldBank1960 = WorldBank[WorldBank$year == 1960,]
WorldBank2014 = WorldBank[WorldBank$year == 2014,]

# [4 pts]
# Make a histogram of GDP only for observations where the lending rating is "IDA"
# The width of the bars should be approximately 250 (use breaks to set how many bars)
# Add an x-axis label and a title.

# [2 pts]
# Create [max.rain], a vector where each entry is the _maximum_ element of the
# corresponding vector in the list rain

max.rain <- sapply(rain, max)

    
# [5 pts]
# Create [max.diff.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# __maximum absolute difference__ in rainfall on two consecutive days
# Hint: you can use the function [diff()] to get the difference between entry i and i+1 in a vector 
# and the function [abs()] for absolute value
max.diff.rain <- sapply(rain, function(x) max(abs(diff(x))))


# [5 pts]
# Create [prop.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# number of rain days (i.e. rain > 0) as a function of total days

prop.rain <- sapply(rain, function(x) length(which(x > 0)) / length(x))
  

# [3 pts]
# Make a plot with 6 panels and plot the histogram of the rainfall for each weather station
# in a separate panel (there will be one empty panel)
# use an apply statment to the the plotting

##### PART IV : functions [20 pts]

# [6 pts]
# Write a function, [GenNorm()] which generates a vector of random normal
# plots a histogram, if desired.

#   sd (the standard deviation), default 1
#   n (the number of observations), default 1000
#   plot.hist (a logical variable, should we plot a histogram), default TRUE
# Output:

#     [cols] : TRUE or FALSE (default TRUE)
# Output :
#     a matrix of the same size as [m] where if cols==TRUE the columns have been standardized
#     and if cols==FALSE the rows have been standardized
#     we standardize by subtracting the mean of the column/row and dividing by the sd of the column/row

#    Assume that [cases] was of length k and [controls] of length m
#    Now select at random k individuals from the whole sample (i.e. all k+m observations)
#    and assign them to be cases, and the remaining m individuals as controls
#    Calculate the value [mean(cases)-mean(controls)] for each of these new samples

# Output
#    A vector of length k where each element is the value 
#    mean(cases)-mean(controls) for one permutation

# There are [k] players that buy a ticket.
# All player with the winning numbers share the jackpot

# Write a function NumJackpot with:

# Output:
#    n.jackpot : vector of length B where each entry is the number of people
#                who shared the jackpot in that game

# So in each of the B games you have to :
#    generate the winning numbers
#    set a counter for jackpot winners to 0
#    generate a ticket for each player in turn, if they had the winning numbers 
#    increase the counter by 1


#NOTE: I ASSUMED THAT ORDER MATTERS
